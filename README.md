Displays given projects I've worked on &amp; info about myself

Description: This application displays a small collection of the various projects that I've worked on that I feel best exemplify my web development aptitude. 
This site also briefly goes over an "about me" section detailing who I am, what I enjoy, & what I stand for. At the bottom you will be able to find a contact form 
(along with links to my social in the footer) where the user will be able to send an email to me concerning anything web dev related.

Project Overview: I originally was planning on using an image for the background, however I later opted for a more simplistic style that I feel conveys who I am more. 
I feel the dark comfy background with the secondary blue color highlights my relaxed personality paired with my thirst for knowledge respectivly.
I ended up putting the gradient at the bottom as a way to break it up & ended up liking how it turned out; later opting to keep the color mesh. With every one of my 
projects I try to throw in something new to keep my learning fresh. With this project, I learned how to properly use forms to send messages to a given email. This was
definitly a highlight of the project for me as seeing testing the message function & then seeing the message in my email was a marvelous experience.
